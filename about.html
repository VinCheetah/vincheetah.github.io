            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Vincent Gardies, and I am a dedicated computer science student at ENS Lyon. My passion for technology drives me to explore innovative solutions in artificial intelligence, optimization, and algorithm design. I have a particular fascination with genetic algorithms and their applications in solving real-world problems.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy engaging in various physical activities like volleyball, tennis, and badminton. I also cherish my time spent horseback riding, which helps me relax and stay connected to nature. Additionally, my two black cats, Cheetah and Mowgli, bring joy and inspiration to my daily life.</p>
            <p>This website serves as a platform to showcase my projects, share my interests, and connect with like-minded individuals. Thank you for visiting!</p>
